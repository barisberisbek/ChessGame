## Usage

1. Start the project by running the `main.java' file.
2. Follow the instructions in the command line to make moves and play the game.

## Features
1. You can end the game when no pieces exist from one color.
2. Pawn can only become a Queen at the last row.
3. Absolute pin: A piece can be played even if it would put the King into check (This means that you can assume Kings can be captured as normal pieces).
4. After a Pawn moves two squares from its starting square, and it could have been captured by an enemy Pawn had it advanced only one square.
5. Pawn is only promoted to Queen.
6. End game control: The game will end when no pieces remain for one color.
7. Promote: Pawns will be automatically promoted to Queens when they reach the last row.
8. Basic movement rules for all pieces: The game allows legal moves for each piece type (excluding complex rules like checkmate, en passant, and absolute pin).
